1. You have a deadline from your product manager for a project and you just figured out it is not possible to meet the deadline. What would be the course of your next actions from this moment on?

I would inform a project menager about any obstacles and try to estimate time required to finish the project. I would also ask the team members if they know how to resolve this problems. If a problem is hard to figure out I would inform Project Manager about it and try to find a solution with him (move the deadline, change the scope of the project, etc.).

2. The project you are working on asks to implement a feature/technology you have never worked with. How would you react?

I like to expose myself to uncharted territory. I would try to learn as much as possible about the feature/technology and try to implement it. If I would have any problems I would ask my team members for help. I had first time experience with the Polkadot api during this project development and I did ok tho.
